If you install carpeting without a pad, it will not be as comfortable to walk on and it will wear out faster. If you install tile on a cracked concrete subfloor it will enventually crack the tile and grout. If you install a wood, cork, or bamboo floating floor on an unlevel subfloor, the edges will not fit well together. Consequently you will stub your toes and eventually destroy that part of the floor.
