In this step by step installation video, we are showing you how to build a wedi Fundo Primo custom shower design and get it ready for tile the same day.
wedi Fundo Primo, a precise, prefabricated solution for custom tiled showers- fast and clean to install

Primo features a factory made, presloped base design, ready to accept small or large format tiles, when cut along the Fundo’s slope lines

Primo is internally waterproof due to its closed cell extruded polystyrene foam core and is coated with a reinforced, cement based resin to allow for great and lasting tile bond

Primo is meant to be installed into wedi’s complete waterproofing and substrate preparation system: join it with wedi building panels for the walls, curbs and the many accessories offered by wedi.

Enjoy a complete system warranty for your shower from base to ceiling.

Detailed installation manuals and more educational support is available at wedi. For our professional contractors wedi offers local certification classes, the wedi online academy or a free certification through one of wedi’s field technicians on site.
