In this step by step installation video, we are showing you how to build a wedi Fundo Ligno curb less and floor level shower and get it ready for tile the same day.
Ligno, a precise, prefabricated solution for curb less, flush floor shower base installations without cutting into floor joists or recessing too deep into floors.

Ligno features a presloped base design only ¾” thick at the perimeter

Ligno is internally waterproof due to its closed cell extruded polystyrene foam core and is coated with a reinforced, cement based resin to allow for great and lasting tile bond

Ligno is meant to be installed into wedi’s complete waterproofing and substrate preparation system: join it with wedi building panels for the walls, subliner dry sheet membrane and the many accessories offered by wedi.

Enjoy a complete system warranty for your shower from base to ceiling.

Detailed installation manuals and more educational support is available at wedi. For our professional contractors wedi offers local certification classes, the wedi online academy or a free certification through one of wedi’s field technicians on site.
